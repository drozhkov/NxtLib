# .NET Framework API for the NXT platform

NxtLib is a .NET library that wraps around Json API in the NXT platform (http://nxt.org/).
NxtLib simplifies the development process when integrating to use the NXT Api since it translates all json into typed .NET code.

It currently supports version 1.4.7 of the NXT Platform.
